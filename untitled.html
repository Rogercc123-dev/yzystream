It captures Kanye in his formative stage as both a producer and a rapper, blending soulful sample-driven beats with lyrics that hint at the themes he would later fully explore in his debut album. Though not an official release, it gained popularity through fan circulation and remains a snapshot of his artistic evolution before mainstream success.</div>

This volume feels slightly more refined, with tracks featuring Consequence, John Legend, and other frequent Kanye collaborators.

                <div class="info">As far back as 2003, Kanye had planned a four-album series revolving around going to college, with Good Ass Job concluding the series. The death of his mother derailed this plan, with his fourth album becoming the somber 808s and Heartbreak. People still expected Good Ass Job to release, though, as Kanye's next album as late as early 2010. When the wake of the 2009 VMAs incident happened, it would cause Good Ass Job not to release. The title seems to have changed to MBDTF around May 2010 or atleast not called GAJ anymore. The cover included for this era is the original cover for the single "POWER."</div>

                <div class="info">After Rick Rubin and Kanye West cut down Yeezus to the final ten tracks, Kanye still saw potential in much of the cut material. Thus, shortly after Yeezus was released, an EP of leftovers titled Lost Yeezus was already being teased. The project then evolved into a full-fledged album of mostly new material, with Yeezus 2 acting as a codename before they could choose the last name. This project would develop into So Help Me God as the songs evolved.</div>

Essentially being a more advanced version of the songs developed during the Yeezus 2 era, So Help Me God gained significant hype as the teaser tracks of "Wolves," "All Day," and "Only One" was revealed to the public. Despite intending to release the album in March 2015, Kanye never finished So Help Me God, and only a few songs from the era ended up on The Life of Pablo.</div>

It was originally announced in 2015, then later renamed to Waves before finally becoming TLOP. Around that time, Ye shared a tracklist for SWISH and dropped songs like "Real Friends" and "No More Parties in LA." The list included an early version of "Famous" called "Nina Chop," named after the Nina Simone sample it used. The cover art featured a character resembling his then-wife, along with an explicit photo of her on the side.</div>

                <div class="info">On March 6th, 2025, Ye tweeted, "this next album got that antisemitic sound" and "my new sound called antisemitic". This would mark a shift in Ye's soundscape, as his antisemitic ideas had been mostly contained to his Twitter at that time, besides a few one-off remarks about Jews on the VULTURES albums. On March 16th, 2025, Ye would tweet an image of a red swastika against a black background, declaring it as a "NEW ALBUM COVER". On April 2nd. 2025, DJ Akademiks would post a series of Tweets that eventually led to the announcement of a new album titled "WW3", separating this project from BULLY.</div>

                <div class="info">On September 3rd, 2024, the CEO of Channel Candy, Ye's new touring company, confirmed that work on a new solo Ye album had began after the South Korea Vultures listening experience. On September 28th, 2024, on the second Haikou listening event, Ye confirmed that the album name is Bully, which references the movie with the same name that he posted on his Instagram story a few days prior to the event. On January 2nd, 2025, Ye announced the album would have AI on it after months of speculation, and that it could help AI become used more in music. After the release of Bully V1, Ye confirms his intention to re-record the AI on Bully, and stated it was being mixed.</div>

                <div class="info">After releasing Donda 2 via the Stem Player in 2022, Ye would eventually move onto other projects. However, the project never left his mind, with some songs continuing to be considered in the Vultures era. 2025 would see Ye enter a new era of creative fuel, once again working on multiple projects at once. With plans to release BULLY and CUCK, Ye has released Donda 2 on DSPs promising live updates to the album.</div>
