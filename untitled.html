It captures Kanye in his formative stage as both a producer and a rapper, blending soulful sample-driven beats with lyrics that hint at the themes he would later fully explore in his debut album. Though not an official release, it gained popularity through fan circulation and remains a snapshot of his artistic evolution before mainstream success.</div>

This volume feels slightly more refined, with tracks featuring Consequence, John Legend, and other frequent Kanye collaborators. The tape gives fans a deeper look into Kanye’s creative process during the mid-2000s, offering glimpses of songs that were either reworked or left behind entirely.</div>

                <div class="info">As far back as 2003, Kanye had planned a four-album series revolving around going to college, with Good Ass Job concluding the series. The death of his mother derailed this plan, with his fourth album becoming the somber 808s and Heartbreak. People still expected Good Ass Job to release, though, as Kanye's next album as late as early 2010. When the wake of the 2009 VMAs incident happened, it would cause Good Ass Job not to release. The title seems to have changed to MBDTF around May 2010 or atleast not called GAJ anymore. The cover included for this era is the original cover for the single "POWER."</div>

Despite intending to release the album in March 2015, Kanye never finished So Help Me God, and only a few songs from the era ended up on The Life of Pablo.</div>

Around that time, Ye shared a tracklist for SWISH and dropped songs like “Real Friends” and “No More Parties in LA.” The list included an early version of “Famous” called “Nina Chop,” named after the Nina Simone sample it used.

                <div class="info">Upon hearing the beat to "Hurricane" during sessions for Good Ass Job, Kanye became inspired to create a whole new album titled Yandhi. With the album's concept in his mind, Kanye and his producers began frenzied work as they developed multiple new songs throughout September 2018, aiming for a September 29 release date. As they did not meet this deadline, Kanye went to Uganda to conduct further work on the album but delayed it indefinitely on November 13.</div>

Kanye hinted at the project multiple times over the years, most notably in a 2018 tweet stating "Throne 2 coming soon," but no confirmation ever came from Jay-Z. Fans have speculated on potential tracklists and sessions, but as of now, the album remains one of the most anticipated and elusive unreleased collabs in hip-hop history.</div>

Kanye revealed the project through social media and even shared some behind-the-scenes clips from the studio, but the album never saw an official release. Leaked tracks suggest a more polished, cinematic take on his gospel direction, infused with Dre’s signature production style. Despite its hype and anticipation, the album remains locked away, with only fragments leaking online.</div>

                <div class="info">Early working title for what eventually became Donda, and it represents a raw, more minimalist phase of Kanye’s creative journey during that album’s development. The material associated with With Child often leaned into spiritual themes, stripped-down production, and deeply personal lyrics, including songs like “Up from the Ashes.” While much of this material was later altered or left off the final Donda release, fans still regard With Child as a distinct and fascinating phase in Kanye’s ever-evolving catalog.</div>

He hosted a listening party for it in Miami, in which many of the tracks were unfinished. It was released on the Stem Player a few days later, but it was still incomplete. Months later, Ye got into even more controversies, making him get dropped by Adidas, buy the social media Parler, and lose his billionaire status following his proclaiming "White Lives Matter" at Yeezy Season 9.</div>

                <div class="info">scrapped project from 2022 that appeared during Kanye West’s Donda 2 and Stem Player era. The title references the Donny Hathaway song of the same name, which Kanye sampled in one of the tracks he debuted via livestream. The project appeared to blend gospel, soul, and personal reflection, aligning with the stripped-down and emotional vibe of Donda 2. Although no official release occurred, the name lives on as part of Kanye’s enigmatic output during a turbulent creative period.</div>

This would mark a shift in Ye's soundscape, as his antisemitic ideas had been mostly contained to his Twitter at that time, besides a few one-off remarks about Jews on the VULTURES albums. On March 16th, 2025, Ye would tweet an image of a red swastika against a black background, declaring it as a "NEW ALBUM COVER". On April 2nd. 2025, DJ Akademiks would post a series of Tweets that eventually led to the announcement of a new album titled "WW3", separating this project from BULLY.</div>

On January 2nd, 2025, Ye announced the album would have AI on it after months of speculation, and that it could help AI become used more in music. After the release of Bully V1, Ye confirms his intention to re-record the AI on Bully, and stated it was being mixed.</div>

With plans to release BULLY and CUCK, Ye has released Donda 2 on DSPs promising live updates to the album.</div>
