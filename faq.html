        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <h2>What is YZY STREAM?</h2>
        <p>
            YZY STREAM is a fan-built digital space inspired by Kanye West (Ye). It features curated links to Ye-related content, including platforms where he may stream or appear, as well as access to unreleased albums via the independent streaming site <b>[untitled]</b>.
        </p>

        <h2>What is [untitled]?</h2>
        <p>
            <b>[untitled]</b> is a third-party music streaming platform where several unofficial Kanye West projects are hosted. YZY STREAM provides direct links to these albums for fans interested in exploring unreleased or leaked content.
        </p>

        <h2>Is this site official?</h2>
        <p>
            No. YZY STREAM is not affiliated with Kanye West, Yeezy, Def Jam, or any other associated entity. It is an independent fan project created for archival and discovery purposes. If Ye ever wants the domain, we’re open to talks.
        </p>

        <h2>Can I download albums from [untitled]?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes! [unitled] should allow you to download albums. YZY STREAM does not host or distribute any files directly.
        </p>

        <h2>What else will be added?</h2>
        <p>
            As the Ye community grows and changes, so will this site. We may add new links, content sections, or features based on what fans want and what Ye releases. For now, it’s simple and clean.
        </p>
  <h2>Why do you have a Patreon?</h2>
        <p>
           I aim to keep the site ad-free, however it takes a lot of work and I appreciate any support received from Patreon. Subscribers will receieve regular links to exclusive music.
        </p>
        <h2>How can I contact the owner?</h2>
        <p>
